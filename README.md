# COE891 - Software Testing and Quality Assurance  

## 📘 Course Overview

**COE891** explores engineering principles of software validation and verification, focusing on both software-only and software-hardware co-design systems. The course emphasizes embedded systems, System-on-Chip development, and reliability assurance using formal test methods and automated verification.

Key topics include:
- Unit and integration testing with JUnit  
- Structural testing: control flow, data flow, and logic coverage  
- Mutation testing and fault injection  
- Automated web application testing  
- Electronic Design Automation (EDA) verification tools  
- Model-based test design and evaluation metrics  

This repository includes labs, project code, test plans, reports, and supporting material for the **Flight Booking System** final project.
